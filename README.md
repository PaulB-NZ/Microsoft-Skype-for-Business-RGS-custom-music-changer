This script was created to allow a customer to quickly change the audio file (MOH) used by a particular RGS workflow. The idea was initially for an IT Service Desk  that would announce known outages etc by means of their hold queue music. Select the required Audio Announcement file in the Menu list, or selecting a custom audio file to set as the Workflows "CustomMusicOnHold".

Of course you can use the script to cycle through sales or marketing announcements. Perhaps team announcements or reminders etc.
